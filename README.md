Project Overview



In this project, I will analyze bike share system data for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will import the data and utilize descriptive statistics to answer insightful questions about the bike share systems. Additionally, I will create an interactive experience in the terminal where users can input their preferences to explore specific statistics.

Required Software
To complete this project, the following software is necessary:

Python
A text editor (e.g., Sublime, Atom)
A terminal application
The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, include randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The core data columns are:

Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration
Start Station
End Station
User Type
The Chicago and New York City datasets also include the following columns:

Gender
Birth Year
Questions to Answer
By writing code in Python, I will address the following questions about the bike share data:

Which month has the highest occurrence in the start time?
Which day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) is most frequent in the start time?
What hour of the day is most common in the start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
Which start station and end station are most frequently used?
What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station)?
How many users belong to each user type?
How many users are there for each gender?
What is the earliest birth year (oldest person), the most recent birth year, and the most common birth year?
The Interactive Experience
To enhance user engagement, I will develop a script that accepts raw input in the terminal to present the statistics dynamically. Users can specify their preferences, such as city, month, day, etc., to retrieve customized statistics. Below are example screenshots of the interactive experience for querying information in Chicago for the month of January on a Sunday.
